```lrc
[00:00.76] Nightingale is singing that familiar tune
[00:06.68] Praising moon and the undeniable truth
[00:12.26] Suddenly it stops, even wind holds its breath
[00:17.95] Is that a scar on the heart of the moon?
[00:37.95] 
[00:23.83] How strange, how bizarre
[00:29.44] Echoes of chaos sound different this time
[00:34.90] Who will bring clarity?
[00:40.98] Who will rewrite the causality?
[00:56.48] 
[00:49.04] (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[00:54.89] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[01:04.39] 
[01:11.33] Every fold of light, every ripple of tides
[01:16.79] I know them all like the lines on my palm
[01:22.71] Pluck the trembling needle out of fate's compass
[01:29.06] To sew my hopes where none remain
[01:45.56] 
[01:34.35] Moonlight, moonlight
[01:40.06] Too long have I followed your sacred guide
[01:45.42] You drew the tides, drowned my yesterdays
[01:51.25] Tonight you'll learn I'm the anchor of fate
[02:12.75] 
[02:20.23] Prophecy puffs into ash
[02:26.02] Dusting her lashes and hair
[02:32.04] The phantoms of paradox
[02:37.60] Melt in her luminous glow, ah
[02:52.10] 
[02:46.20] Wax wane turns of fate
[02:52.01] No one could outpace her soaring silhouette
[02:57.82] Draw, hold, release it to the moon
[03:03.73] She's the path, the only answer to all
[03:22.73] 
[03:10.39] (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
[03:20.68] Stars flow like sand
[03:26.57] I'm the scale, the scars on time's wrist
